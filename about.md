As Senior Web Developer in charge, William Anderson (me) leads web development efforts at Addison. I have been programming since 2001 over a wide array of languages and technologies. Prior to his joining Addison, I co-founded another NYC-based creative agency (Index Interactive), where I served as Lead Developer. I have guest lectured at The New School on subjects ranging from the business of code to programming automated Twitter bots, and been published in the Parson's Journal of Information Mapping for writings on the relationships between complications and adjacencies.

In my free time I [illustrate](http://thewa.tumblr.com/), and [make things](http://thewilliamanderson.com/), and rant on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thewaanderson). Well, all of that if I'm not out spending time with my [wife](http://yitinganderson.com/).

Please feel free to reach out to me for talks, tutoring, coffee, or rants about Dwarf Fortress via my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/thewaanderson) or [email](mailto:thewilliamanderson@gmai.com).
